focus more on staging (possibly have 2 env one with staging and one with prod)
change title and take home message
week 7 lab oct 9 1pm


Timing
The time was good at 7:02


Relevant, clearly motivated:
The motivation was good and nicely utilized audience interaction


Narrative: contains a good narrative

The narrative was hard to follow during the demo. We perceived it as a string of "and then" steps without much of a story. 

 

Difficulty: demonstration is difficult to do

It was not trivial, but we would like to see a bit more difficulty if possible.

 

Speech: accompanied by clear, structured speech
One speaker mostly read rather than presented. The other was a bit hard to follow at times during the demo with lots of uhms and pauses while running the demo.

 

Originality: few demos/tutorials exist on the topic

You clearly put the demo together, but there are tutorials om spinning up and spinning things down with Terraform. You did do some manual docker in the middle which is original but was unfortunately a bit confusing for the listener.


Aesthetics: visually appealing
The slides were good. During the demo the text was a bit small.

I put a 0 mainly to encourage you to consider the text size during your next demo.

 

Engagement: audience engaged (e.g., easter egg)

You engaged with the audience in a fun way and also had an easter egg


Liveness: code/config updated live

You made some code changes but these were the application instead of the IaC. You did run some commands manually but by writing them manually you may have wasted some time.


Take-home: includes clear and visible take-home message
We would like to see a more deep and relevant take-home message specific to the demo.
